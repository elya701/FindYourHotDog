Thank you for downloading my hotdog file.
Included in the file:

obp files for Bryce 6 (it will probably work in earlier versions too)
Obj files

The obp file has all the materials applied.
The obj files come with templates and image maps.
Feel free to make your own image maps and/or apply your own materials.

A simple plain hotdog in a bun.
